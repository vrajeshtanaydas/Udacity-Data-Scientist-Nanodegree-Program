1. Installation

    pyecharts(0.5.5)
    The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

2. Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2011 to 2018 to better understand:

        1.Which languages were most popular in each year?
        2.Which occupations were most popular in each year?
        3.What is the average IT experience of programmers in different countries each year?
        4.What is the average age of programmers in different countries each year?
        5.What is the average salary of the participants in different countries each year?
        6.What is the average salary of the participants in different countries each year?

3. File Descriptions

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to merge surveys in different years and visualize the results of above questions.
4. Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the following link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
