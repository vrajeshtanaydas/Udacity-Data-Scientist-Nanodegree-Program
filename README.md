## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- pyecharts(0.5.5)
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2011 to 2018 to better understand:
> * 1.Which languages were most popular in each year?  
> * 2.Which occupations were most popular in each year?  
> * 3.What is the average IT experience of programmers in different countries each year?  
> * 4.What is the average age of programmers in different countries each year? 
> * 5.What is the average salary of the participants in different countries each year?  
> * 6.What is the average salary of the participants in different countries each year? 

## 3. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>  
There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to merge surveys in different years and visualize the results of above questions.

## 4. Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@524022279/six-trends-about-developer-from-2011-to-2018-fac7f237567e).
